NOTE: Current compiler settings for VS17 Win32 with x86 settings and support for AVX2 instruction set


SFML
	-Project properties 
		-The path to the SFML headers (<sfml-install-path>/include) to C/C++ » General » Additional Include Directories
		-The path to the SFML libraries (<sfml-install-path>/lib) to Linker » General » Additional Library Directories

	-Linker >> Input >> Additional dependencies (Static)
		- sfml-system-s.lib; sfml-graphics-s.lib; sfml-window-s.lib; sfml-audio-s.lib; sfml-network-s.lib
